<h1>OSM Then And Now</h1>

This was OSM Then and Now, which would show you how OSM looked in 2007 and now, side by side.

The service is now decommissioned.

If you're interested in recreating it, I have the Carto style sheet, renderd config, and a osm2pgsql database dump. Contact me if you're interested.

Onward, Martijn
