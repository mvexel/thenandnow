# OSM Then And Now

View OpenStreetMap as it was in January 2008, and compare it to what it looks now.

**This is just a readme left over from the previous live site which was hosted on Github pages.**

There is a live version at https://2008.osm.lol/ 

See [this repo](https://github.com/mvexel/openstreetmap-vintage-tile-server) for code and instructions to set up your own.
